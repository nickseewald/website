        > The best thing about being a statistician is that you get to play in everyone's backyard. &nbsp; &nbsp;  -John Tukey.

        Statistics, at its core, is about communication. Ultimately, my job as a collaborative statistician is to convey a message from data to colleagues, partners, and patients. My primary goal in teaching is to train my students to engage in this process of communication: to understand how to glean knowledge from data and share that knowledge effectively.

        I am a passionate and [award-winning](https://rackham.umich.edu/faculty-and-staff/awards/outstanding-graduate-student-instructor-awards/) statistics educator. My pedagogy focuses on developing and leveraging students' statistical intuition, rather than teaching a suite of procedures, so they are better equipped to enter a rapidly changing world of data science. To do this, I engage students in their own knowledge-building through active learning techniques, judiciously incorporate technology, and use low-stakes assessments encouraging trial and error.

        I am committed to meeting students where they are and building biostatistical skills and interest appropriate for their academic goals.
