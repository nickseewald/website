I develop statistical methodology to answer questions about health policy and precision health using complex longitudinal data. 

My work is primarily related to causal inference with complex multilevel data. I have expertise in both experimental and non-experimental approaches to causal inference, especially with sequential multiple-assignment randomized trials and difference-in-differences. 

My methodological research is motivated by the need for statistical tools to help investigators answer key questions in public health and medicine through thoughtful study design and analysis. My work spans the entire investigative process from formulating a research question through study design and data analysis and is built around deep collaboration with applied scientists. 

Currently, I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Health Policy and Management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, working with [Elizabeth Stuart, Ph.D.](https://www.elizabethstuart.org/) and [Beth McGinty, Ph.D.](https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/2908/emma-beth-mcginty) on causal inference for health policy evaluation.

My Ph.D. was supervised by [Daniel Almirall, Ph.D.](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~dalmiral/)
