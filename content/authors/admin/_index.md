#### I am a collaborative biostatistician who builds tools to enable high quality, impactful science. 

I develop methods and collaborations that create knowledge to improve human health.
My work is driven by a commitment to build usable and accessible methods, and 
I am driven by deep substantive collaboration across disciplines.
I am interested in bridging gaps between statistical theory and practice, and
building and disseminating tools to help scientists across fields -- including
oncology, health policy, substance use, and implementation science -- ask better
questions and arrive at trustworthy answers.  

#### I am an expert in causal inference with complex repeated-measures data. 

I have deep expertise in the design and analysis of sequential,
multiple-assignment randomized trials (SMARTs), particularly those with 
longitudinal outcomes. In non-experimental settings, my work focuses on
statistical issues in the use of multilevel data for health policy evaluation.
