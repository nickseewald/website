abstract: |
  **Importance**: Nationwide data are unavailable regarding changes in intensive care unit (ICU) outcomes and use of life support over the past 10 years, limiting understanding of practice changes.
  
  **Objective**: To portray the epidemiology of US critical care before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
  
  **Design, Setting and Participants**: Retrospective cohort study of adult patients admitted to an ICU for any reason, using data from the 54 US health systems continuously contributing to the Epic Cosmos database from 2014-2023.
  
  **Exposures**: Patient demographics, COVID-19 status, and pandemic era.
  
  **Main Outcomes and Measures**: In-hospital mortality unadjusted and adjusted for patient demographics, comorbidities, and illness severity; ICU length of stay; and receipt of life-support interventions, including mechanical ventilation and vasopressor medications.
  
  **Results**: Of 3,453,687 admissions including ICU care, median age was 65 (IQR, 53-75) years. Patients were 55.3% male; 17.3% Black and 6.1% Hispanic or Latino; and overall in-hospital mortality was 10.9%. The adjusted in-hospital mortality was elevated during the pandemic in COVID-negative (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.3 [95% CI, 1.2-1.3]) and COVID-positive (aOR, 4.3 [95% CI, 3.8-4.8]) patients and returned to baseline by mid-2022. The median ICU length of stay was 2.1 (IQR, 1.1-4.2) days, with increases during the pandemic among COVID-positive patients (difference for COVID-positive vs COVID-negative patients, 2.0 days [95% CI, 2.0-2.1]). Rates of invasive mechanical ventilation were 23.2% (95% CI, 23.1%-23.2%) before the pandemic, increased to 25.8% (95% CI, 25.8%-25.9%) during the pandemic, and declined below prepandemic baseline thereafter (22.0% [95% CI, 21.9%-22.2%]). The use of vasopressors increased from 7.2% to 21.6% of ICU stays.
  
  **Conclusions and Relevance**: Pandemic-era increases in length of stay and adjusted in-hospital mortality among US ICU patients returned to recent historical baselines. Fewer patients are now receiving mechanical ventilation than prior to the pandemic, while more patients are administered vasopressor medications.
  

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "A collaborative paper led my MSCE student Emily Moin, MD. Following pandemic-era changes, many ICU outcome measures returned to prior levels. The rates of mechanical ventilation have declined even further, while vasopressor use remained elevated above 2010s rates. "
