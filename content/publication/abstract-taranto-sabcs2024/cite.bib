  abstract = {Background: Recurrence after early-stage breast cancer (BC) is a challenge, occurring in {$\sim$}30\% of patients (pts). Recurrences may arise from reactivation of disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) persisting in a dormant state after primary treatment. The presence of minimal residual disease (MRD) as bone marrow DTCs and/or circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the blood increases the risk of BC recurrence/death. It remains unclear which pts with DTCs will have these reactivate or develop detectable ctDNA before clinical relapse. We evaluated the association and temporal relationship of ctDNA with DTCs in a population of high-risk BC survivors, and the relationship of these markers with subsequent metastatic recurrence. Methods: ``PENN SURMOUNT'' is a single center, prospective, longitudinal cohort study examining MRD biomarkers among pts within 5 years (y) of BC diagnosis who completed all curative treatment except endocrine therapy. Eligible pts must have had: 1) TNBC, or 2) HER2+ or HR+ BC with positive LN and/or residual disease after neoadjuvant therapy, or 3) HR+ BC with a 21-gene Recurrence score \&gt;25 and/or high risk Mammaprint. Pts had annual bone marrow aspirate (BMA) for DTCs by immunohistochemistry (using methods of Naume et al.). DTC+ pts went on therapeutic trial; DTC- pts had up to 5y of annual BMA and blood testing. ctDNA was retrospectively assessed using the RaDaR assay, which targets pt-specific somatic mutations identified by whole-exome sequencing (WES) of primary tumor tissue. Results: Of 184 pts enrolled from 2016 -- 2021, 121 had tissue available; 114/121 (94\%) had successful WES. A total of 338 plasma samples from 96 pts (median 2 timepoints each, range 1-12) have been successfully tested by RaDaR to date. Overall, ctDNA was detected in 11 samples from 9/96 pts (9.3\%) with a median eVAF of 0.009\% (range 0.002-0.084\%). Two pts were ctDNA+ at baseline (BL), and 7 became positive on surveillance. 87/96 (90.6\%) were ctDNA- across all timepoints. 34/96 pts (35\%) were DTC+, either at BL (n=24, 25\%) or after (n=10, 10\%). Considering all timepoints, concordance was 64\%. Of 34 ever-DTC+ pts, 4 (12\%) were ctDNA+ (of whom 3/4 recurred) and 30 remained ctDNA- (with 1/30 who recurred). Among the 62 pts who remained DTC-, 5 (8\%) were ctDNA+ (with 5/5 who recurred), and 57 remained ctDNA- (of whom 5/57 recurred). All ctDNA positivity in DTC+ pts occurred at the time of or after DTC positivity. Over median follow-up (f/u) of 65 months (m), BC recurrence occurred in 14/96 pts (15\%), with 2 locoregional-only and 12 distant +/- locoregional recurrences (involving the bone, liver, lung/pleura, and brain); 8/14 pts (57\%) were ctDNA+ prior to relapse. 7/12 (58\%) with distant recurrences were ctDNA+ prior to metastatic diagnosis, at a median lead time of 15 m (range 0 -- 25). Overall, ctDNA+ pts experienced a median lead time from ctDNA positivity to recurrence of 13 m (range 0 -- 25). Only 1 of 9 ctDNA+ pts has not recurred; this pt was DTC+ and went on therapeutic trial, without evidence of recurrence over 20 m f/u. 30/34 DTC+ pts (89\%) who went on therapeutic trial have not had ctDNA detected during f/u and have not recurred. Overall, ctDNA status was significantly associated with relapse (p\&lt;0.01), with a PPV of 89\% and NPV of 93\%. Of the 24 BL DTC+ pts, 2 became ctDNA+ at subsequent timepoints, an average of 18 m after DTC assessment, and both relapsed (3 and 5 m from ctDNA detection, respectively). Conclusions: In this surveillance study of high-risk BC pts, DTC+ pts were identified who subsequently developed detectable ctDNA and clinical relapse. Where there were discordant results, the timing of DTC and ctDNA positivity revealed a window of opportunity for intervention. A strategy combining both markers for surveillance and intervention to prevent metastatic disease may be of value.Citation Format: Eleanor Taranto, Nicholas J. Seewald, Lauren J.
