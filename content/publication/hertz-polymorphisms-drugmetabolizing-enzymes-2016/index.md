abstract: "Discovery of clinical and genetic predictors of exemestane pharmacokinetics was attempted in 246 postmenopausal patients with breast cancer enrolled on a prospective clinical study. A sample was collected 2â€‰h after exemestane dosing at a 1- or 3-month study visit to measure drug concentration. The primary hypothesis was that patients carrying the low-activity CYP3A4*22 (rs35599367) single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) would have greater exemestane concentration. Additional SNPs in genes relevant to exemestane metabolism (CYP1A1/2, CYP1B1, CYP3A4, CYP4A11, AKR1C3/4, AKR7A2) were screened in secondary analyses and adjusted for clinical covariates. CYP3A4*22 was associated with a 54% greater exemestane concentration (P<0.01). Concentration was greater in patients who reported White race, had elevated aminotransferases, renal insufficiency, lower body mass index and had not received chemotherapy (all P<0.05), and CYP3A4*22 maintained significance after adjustment for covariates (P<0.01). These genetic and clinical predictors of exemestane concentration may be useful for treatment individualization in patients with breast cancer."
