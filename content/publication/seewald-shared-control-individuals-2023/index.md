abstract: Health policy researchers often have questions about the effects of a policy
  implemented at some cluster-level unit, e.g., states, counties, hospitals, etc.
  on individual-level outcomes collected over multiple time periods. Stacked difference-in-differences
  is an increasingly popular way to estimate these effects. This approach involves
  estimating treatment effects for each policy-implementing unit, then, if scientifically
  appropriate, aggregating them to an average effect estimate. However, when individual-level
  data are available and non-implementing units are used as comparators for multiple
  policy-implementing units, data from untreated individuals may be used across multiple
  analyses, thereby inducing correlation between effect estimates. Existing methods
  do not quantify or account for this sharing of controls. Here, we describe a stacked
  difference-in-differences study investigating the effects of state medical cannabis
  laws on treatment for chronic pain management that motivated this work, discuss
  a framework for estimating and managing this correlation due to shared control individuals,
  and show how accounting for it affects the substantive results.
