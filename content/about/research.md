I develop novel methods for the collection and analysis of complex longitudinal data for precision health. Currently, I am interested in the design of sequential, multiple-assignment randomized trials (SMARTs) with longitudinal outcomes, which allow interventionists to more fully understand patient trajectories in response to tailored, sequential treatment delivery. I am particularly focused on creating tools which place my methods directly in the hands of domain scientists, and lower the barrier to entry for SMARTs.

I was the primary data analyst on HeartSteps, the first ever micro-randomized trial (MRT), and co-developed a Shiny app for computing sample size for MRTs, under the direction of [Susan A. Murphy, Ph.D.](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~samurphy/). Through this work, I was also able to develop guidance on how to use automated systems to collect and manage research-grade data for MRTs.

I have a strong record of cross-disciplinary collaboration, serving as a trainee on an NIH-funded training grant for cancer biostatistics (NIH 5T32CA083654-12, P.I. [Jeremy M.G. Taylor, Ph.D.](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/taylor-jeremy.html)) under the supervision of [Kelley M. Kidwell, Ph.D.](https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/kidwell/home). As an undergraduate at the University of Notre Dame, I worked with [Seth N. Brown, Ph.D.](https://chemistry.nd.edu/people/seth-n-brown/) on kinetics of reduction-oxidation reactions involving molybdenum complexes. I wrote my undergraduate thesis on Shannon entropy and its applications in combinatorics under the direction of [David Galvin, Ph.D.](https://www3.nd.edu/~dgalvin1/).
