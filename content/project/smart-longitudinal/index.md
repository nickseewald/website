SMARTs are randomized trials in which some or all participants are randomized more than once, often with the
goal of constructing a high-quality dynamic treatment regime (DTR). This work provides applied scientists with
design tools needed to power a SMART when the primary goal is to compare two embedded DTRs on a continuous outcome
collected over the course of multiple stages of randomization.
