Liquid biopsy uses non-solid biological tissue (e.g., blood) for prognosis and
monitoring of various conditions, including cancer. In this series of
collaborations with [Erica L. Carpenter, MBA,
PhD](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p4879423), we
investigate various biomarkers -- including and especially circulating tumor
cells and cell-free DNA -- for their capacity to provide early detection of
disease or ability to improve prognosis. I provide statistical expertise
