HeartSteps was the first-ever micro-randomized trial (MRT) designed to optimize
a just-in-time adaptive intervention to increase physical activity among
sedentary adults. In collaboration with study PI [Predrag Klasnja,
PhD](https://www.pedjaklasnja.com/) and [Susan A. Murphy,
PhD](https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~samurphy/), I served as the trial's
primary data analyst.
