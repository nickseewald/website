Health policy has meaningful impacts on peoples' lives, but those impacts are
often difficult to study due to data availibility and the complexity of the
policymaking process. In this series of collaborations, I provide statistical
expertise to enable high-quality, trustworthy evaluation of the effects of
health policies as they affect substance use in the United States, particularly
in regards to the opioid epidemic. My primary collaborator in this space is
[Beth McGinty, PhD](https://vivo.weill.cornell.edu/display/cwid-emm4010), chief
of the Division of Health Policy and Economics at Weill Cornell Medical College.
