summary: |
  A methods webinar in a series sponsored by the NIMH-funded Johns Hopkins ALACRITY Center for Health and Longevity in Mental Illness, aiming to highlight advanced quantitative methods and mixed methods to help answer important questions in mental health services research. 

abstract: |
  Estimating the impact of mental health policy is challenging, often due to small sample sizes and high heterogeneity across different policy implementations. Target trial emulation, an approach to designing rigorous nonexperimental studies by “emulating” key features of a clinical trial, can help. Most commonly used outside of policy contexts, this approach is also valuable for policy evaluation as policies typically are not randomly assigned. In this webinar, I introduce the policy trial emulation framework and discuss how it can be used to assess the effect of a health policy on clinical or population health outcomes.
