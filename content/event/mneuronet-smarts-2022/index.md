summary: "A 45-minute seminar on dynamic treatment regimens (DTRs) and sequential multiple-assignment randomized trials geared towards a clinical audience." 
abstract: There is growing interest in developing evidence-based sequences of treatment which are able to adapt to an individual's changing needs over time. In this talk, I introduce dynamic treatment regimens, which seek to operationalize clinical practice in the sense that they provide a set of individualized treatment recommendations, and sequential multiple-assignment randomized trials, which help scientists answer questions about dynamic treatment regimens. The talk is aimed at a clinical audience, and uses an example from the field of alcohol use disorder.
